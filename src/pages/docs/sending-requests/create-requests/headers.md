## Configuring request headers

Some APIs require you to send particular headers along with requests, typically to provide more metadata about the operation you are performing. You can set these up in the __Headers__ tab. Enter any key-value pairs you need and Postman will send them along with your request. As you enter text, Postman prompts you with common options you can use to autocomplete your setup, such as `Content-Type`.

> You can save commonly used headers together in a header preset. In the __Headers__ tab, select __Presets__, and choose __Manage Presets__. Add each preset by providing a name, and entering the key plus value. Select __Add__ and your preset will be available in the __Presets__ dropdown list. Selecting the preset will autopopulate the fields in your request headers.

## Autogenerated headers

Postman will automatically add certain headers to your requests based on your request selections and settings. Select __hidden__ at the top of the headers tab for information about what Postman will send with your request.

Hover over a header for details about it. Postman will indicate why the header has been added. The detail will indicate how to deactivate or override a header value if you need to.

> Deactivating or overriding recommended headers may make your request behave unexpectedly.

If you need to change a header, you can do so in the relevant part of Postman, for example the __Authorization__ tab, the request __Body__, __Cookies__ for the request domain, the __Settings__, and in some cases directly in the __Headers__ tab itself.

If you need to go to a different part of the app, Postman will show a link on the right-hand side.

If a header has been added based on your auth setup, [select the __Authorization__ tab](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/) to change it.

To alter cookie headers, [change the cookie setup](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) for the domain you're sending the request to.

To deactivate an autogenerated header directly in __Headers__, clear its checkbox. To override an autogenerated header value, uncheck the autogenerated entry and add a separate entry for the header, listing its name in the __Key__ field and specifying your value in the __Value__ field.

If you have more than one entry for the same header, Postman will indicate which one will be overridden, prioritizing headers you have either explicitly added directly in __Headers__ or indirectly with selections you made in the other parts of your request such as __Authorization__.

For `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers, Postman will automatically calculate values when you send your request, based on the data in the __Body__ tab. However, you can override both values.

Once your headers and other request details are set up, you can select __Send__ to run your request.
